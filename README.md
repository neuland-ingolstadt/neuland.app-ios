# neuland.app for iOS


**An open source, iOS native replacement for the official app of the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt build with SwiftUI.**

## About 
### App
The structure and functions are based on the web-based [neuland.app](https://neuland.app), but written in the latest version of the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework.
This provides a familiar iOS design and makes it easy to add features like widgets or an Apple Watch app, as well as take advantage of OS-specific security features and performance.

### Downlaod
The app will be available for download in the iOS and macOS Store at a later date, and a beta version will also be offered via TestFlight. 
Meanwhile, the WebApp will be offered as a [cross-platform version](https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app-ios/tree/main) soon.

### Documentation
Look into the [original repository](https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app) of the web app, which contains the source code and the documentation, e.g. about the APIs used.
